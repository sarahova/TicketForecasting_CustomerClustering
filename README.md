# Ticket Forecasting and Customer Clustering

This is forecasting and clustering project I worked on. 
The data is dummy stadium data that includes the following:

* ticket purchases made from Jan 1, 2017 to Aug 31, 2019 (includes purchases for games up to Sept 29, 2019).
* ticket scans for games from Jan 1, 2017 to Aug 31, 2019.
* game data (e.g. events, holdiays, wins, losses, etc.)

The goal of the project is to answer the following questions:
 
 * Ticket Sales Forecast: predict the number of tickets purchased for the games on Sept 27, 28, 29 of 2019. And how will those tickets be distributed by section level in the stadium ( 100, 200, 500 level).

 * Ticket Scan Forecast: predict the number of tickets that will be scanned for the games on Sept 27, 28, 29 of 2019. And how will those tickets be distributed in terms of ticket type (Single Games, Season Ticket, Group, etc.). 

 * Customer Clustering of Single Ticket Buyers: Perform an RFM analysis on the Single Ticket Buyers to categorize them as low, mid, and high value customers.
